remedy better solution for eslint rules in netlify functions

Either disable es rules for specific folder like below
disable an ESLint rule for an entire folder by creating a specific .eslintrc file within that folder. ESLint supports multiple configuration files, and the configuration in a directory will apply to files within that directory and its subdirectories. Here's how to do it:

Navigate to the folder where you want to disable the rule.
Create a new ESLint configuration file (.eslintrc, .eslintrc.js, .eslintrc.json, etc.) in that folder.
In this new configuration file, extend your main configuration and disable the specific rule.

{
  "extends": "../.eslintrc.json",
  "rules": {
    "import/no-anonymous-default-export": "off"
  }
}



or

download 
npm i @netlify/eslint-config-node

should i do api calls as serve-side fetching

For client-side data fetching, you can use React's useEffect hook to call the function when the component mounts.

Server-Side Fetching: (Using getServerSideProps in pages/index.js)

Alternatively, if you want to fetch the data on the server-side and send it as a prop to your page, use getServerSideProps:

Not really sure if my API return should be json or plain english.
